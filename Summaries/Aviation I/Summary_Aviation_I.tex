\section{Air Transport as part of overall traffic}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Air transport: On one hand dismissed as commodity, on the other as as magnet for the population (high interest)
    \item Economist perspective: Air transport as part of econom. transport system
    \item Modern economy: Division of labour: Pre-requisite for this is a functioning air transport system
    \item Air transport is an \textbf{indicator of wealth and poverty}
    \item \textbf{Globalisation} builds strongly on air transport 
    \item Strong growth projected (based on CAGR of 3.7\% $\rightarrow$ 7.2 billion in 2035 / double of 2016 )
\end{itemize}

\underline{\textbf{Air transport vs. Aviation}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Air traffic/transport}: All operations used to change location of people, freight and post by air and incorporates all services directly associated with the change of location (flight, catering, airport)
    \item \textbf{Aviation}: Air transport + in-kind services to produce air transport services (manufacturing of airplanes and traffic control systems)
\end{itemize}

\underline{\textbf{Systemization of Air Transport}}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Functional specification: Civil/Military
    \item Transport Object: Passenger/Freight/Post
    \item Commercial: Public/not public
    \item Non-commercial (not-public): Factory flights, company (internal), private, state
    \item Length of leg: Short (2000km), Mid (5000km), Long
    \item Legal: Inland(domestic), Cross-border (international)
    \item Aircraft Type (Engine): Turbo-prop, Jet, Piston engine
    \item Regularity: Regular (scheduled), On demand (chartered)
    \item Business model: Network / charter / low cost / business jet 
\end{itemize}

\underline{\textbf{Specialities reg. Supply and Demand}}
In contrast to other modes of transport, air transport has additional, special characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Governmental framework conditions (regulations, state carriers, cabotage ban (no provision of transport services within a country by a foreign transport company))
    \item Special Infrastructure/State Controlled (Airports, air traffic control, SLOT)
    \item Intermodal Transport (dependency, limited ability to network)
    \item High fixed costs / perishable inventory (up to 80\% fixed costs, production and use of services are combined, external production factor)
    \item Derived demand by GDP, and income as driver for demand
    \item Deregulation has increased supply (LCC)
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Performance Metrics for Air Transport}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $PKM = PAX \cdot KM$ (passenger km = pax times km)
    \item $TKM = Tonne \cdot KM$ (transport/tonne km)
    \item Supply: $ASK = Available~Seats \cdot KM$ (available seat km)
    \item Demand: $RPK = Seats~sold~(passengers) \cdot KM$ (revenue passenger km)
    \item $PKM = 1.852\cdot PM$ (Miles - KM)
    \item $SLF = RPK / ASK$ (seat load factor in percentage), analogous for CLF (cargo load factor)
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Air transport data - Global (IATA) 2017 - see slide 15}} \\ \\
\underline{\textbf{Air transport and COVID}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Demand shocks normally do not have long-lasting impacts (previously shocks of RPK minus 5-20\%, but recovery after 6-18 months)
    \item RPK is depending on regions (high RPK in Asia Pacific, Europe, lower in Africa)
    \item Different markets recover at different paces (depending on vaccine availability, large markets, GDP and leisure markets)
    \item High uncertainty for prediction: 2036-2037 - uncertainties include: COVID development, Business travels, Global economy, Global security, Climate attitude
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Air transport in Europe}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Overall increase in SLF, PKM
    \item Seasonality: Summer season 50\% more flights
    \item EU traffic mainly stays in EU
    \item Largest traffic is LDN Heathrow (77m / year) in terms of PAX, Paris in terms of post/freight
    \item Most of non-EU traffic goes to non-EU Europe (36.4\%), North America (19.8\%) or Near East (13.3\%)
    \item Strongest Airport pairs: Paris-Tolouse, Madrid-Barcelona, largest growth: Palma de Mallorca
    \item Nearly all domestic flights, as carriers work in a hub model
    \item PKM modal split within Europe: Air has 9-10\% share, passenger cars 70\%, Buses and Coaches 8\%, Railways 7\%.
    \item Share of business model within Air transport: 50\% traditional scheduled, 32\% LCC, 7 \% business aviation, 3\% Charter (diminishing due to LCC) 
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Air transport in Switzerland}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Traffic volume in comparison to GDP: Even though share of modes is low, air transport is 17x of Swiss GDP
    \item Lines and charters: stable at 450'000 movements (starts and landings) per year
    \item Increase of PAX by 5\% over time due to high SLF and larger aircrafts

\underline{\textbf{5 - Taxiing to Runway }}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The ATC determines the take-off sequence based on traffic and route 
    \item Different checks are made during taxiing 
    \item The cabin crew prepares the cabin (trolley, stowaway items) and shows safety on board film 
    \item \textbf{Influence on Departure and Landing Sequence by categories of Aircraft (WTC: Wake turbulence category)}: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item J/SUPER (A380)
        \item H/HEAVY (136'000 kg or 3'000'000 LBS) or more
        \item M/MEDIUM (less than H and more than L)
        \item L/LIGHT (7000 kg 15500 LBS) or less
    \end{itemize}
    \item Seperation and LDG: The WTC category defines a separation minimum (in Nautical Miles) from a leading to a following aircraft. Optimally, smaller planes go ahead
    \item Takeoff T/O Minimum (IFR, instrument flight rules): An instrumentally derived horizontal distance a pilot should see down the runway from an approach end, based either on the sighting of high intensity runway lights or on the visual contrasts of objects, whichever yields the greater visual range.
    \item Wind limits and contaminated runways: Crosswinds, tailwinds (normally 10KTS) assumed, and based on runway contamination, different thrust profiles have to be chosen 
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{6 - Take-Off}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Performance Calculations TORA and ASDA, 2nd Segment (to 400 ft, 2.4\% Gradient), Obstacle Clearance
    \item V1 (if smaller, take-off is rejected), Acceleration to VR (take-off rotation starts), V2 (flight continues with this max speed, climb)
    \item Take-off run acceleration (TORA): Acceleration to V1, then one engine fails with acceleration to VR and rotating 
    \item Accelerate Stop Distance Acceleration (ASDA): Acceleration to V1, then reject and stop on runway 
    \item 2nd Segment: Regulations from Authorities: Gradient 2.4\% with one engine operative (normal OPS 13-27\%) and usually for all engine climbs 3.3-10\%
    \item Obstacle clearance
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{7 - Climb}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item FL (flight level) 100 (depending on pressure, but normally 10'000 ft), altitude at standard air pressure: Max 250 KN 
    \item Over FL 100: Speed determined by airline/manufacturer, for optimum efficiency: Normally 280-320 KTS 
    \item Max FL390 (around 37'000 ft): low weight / valid for most airliners 
    \item FL 390: 27 min / 1900 kg fuel burn / 180 NM speed
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{8 - Cruise}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Flight Measurement System (FMS) suggest MAX FL, and based on weight and wind + temperature optimum FL 
    \item MACH around 0.78 (depends on outside temperature, but assume normally 300 m/s or 1080 km/h for speed and sound)
    \item Step Climbs: As the aircraft burns fuel, it becomes lighter and climbs to optimum cruise level. In practice, a step climb is carried out  
    \item \textbf{Terrain/Obstacle Clearance}: Maps are published for minimum flight altitude (MGA, grid altitude), minor sector altitude MSA or min Terrain clearance altitude MTCA.
    \item They all guarantee following margins (even though differently calculated)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Obstacles up to 6000 ft: 1000 ft Margin 
        \item Obstacles above 6000 ft: 2000 ft Margin 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Tasks while cruising: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Flying pilot (FP): Flying, navigation, passenger announcements. Pilot monitoring (PM): Radio, Calculations, systems monitoring. Preparation of turnaround (30-40 min on ground): weather, flight planning, fuel, organisation of trouble-free sequence on ground 
        \item Cabin: starts with seatbelts sign off (FL 100) until seatbelts sign on (15 min befor Landing)
    \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{9 - Descent}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Top of Descent (TOD):Flight Monitoring System (FMS) calculates ideal descent taking constraints into consideration. Speed and attitude readings from approach are determined
    \item Calculation: Normally a 3 degree descent or 5.2\%, distance * 3 = nominal height 
    \item Performance: 17 min / 170 kg Fuel / 110 NM 
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{10 - Approach}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Types of Approaches: Precision Approach, or Non-Precision Approach. Main difference: Non-Precision approach only guides flight crew on lateral axis. Precision approach also on vertical 
    \item Precision Approach: An ILS (instrument landing system) is consists of a localizer (lateral) and a glideslope (vertical). The glideslope leads the aircraft on a 3¬∞ angle to the runway. Red/white station and larger beacons
    \item Non-Precision Approach:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item VOR (VHF omnidirectional range): Allows naviagition on a specific course on or away from the station (FR=from and TO=to, multiple stations 1-6, given in degrees, readings agree with map). VOR station is circular
        \item NDB (Non-directional beacon): NDB only shows the route to/from the station. NDB station is a large antenna above ground 
        \item RNAV/GPS (Area navigation/ global positioning system): Aircraft-based platform which can self determine its position wih the help of VOR, ILS, NDB, GPS and IRS (inertial reference system). Independent from ground (satelite based) and support direct routes instead of routes from station to station
    \end{itemize}
    \item Approach type? Depending on:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Weather: Non-precision approaches need better weather conditions. due to imprecisions. Basically 500ft ceiling (cloud cover), 1500m visibility (ILS: only needs 220ft and 500m)
        \item The on/board aircraft installations 
        \item Qualification of Crew members (for Cat. 2 or 3 approaches)
        \item Needs of the crew (training)
        \item Preference of the airfield/ATC (Noise, efficiency)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Fog - Low visibility approaches:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Cloud base 200ft/500m visibility: Cat 1 approach via ILS. If visibility is below 400m RVR, then low visibility approach. Lower sequences, greater spacing in the air and on the ground are consequence
        \item Category 2: 100ft/300m. Requirements: Qualified crew, minimum 1 auto-pilot (AP), 2 Pilots, Procedure Autoland
        \item Category 3A: 50ft/200m. Requirements:Additionally to Cat 2, autothrust 
        \item Category 3B: No/75m. Requirements: Additional to Cat 3A, 2 AP, auto rollout and also often auto brake 
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{11 - Landing}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Begins 50ft on the centerline and should be landed within 300-600m in touchdown zone 
    \item Braking: Carbon brakes, Reverse Thrust, Ground Spoilers 
    \item The landing distance is defined as the effective distance from 50ft above ground until still stand. A safety margin is built in. Measuring the landing distance, this LD=60\% Length of required landing distance needed. Margin is total Runway (TR - LD/0.6 = Margin)
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{12 - Standing at place or at gate + Turnaround}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Rolling to standing place via signs or marshalls
    \item GPU is attached or APU switched on when engines are shut down
    \item Turnaround time is 30-40 min. This includes
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Passengers leave
        \item Aircraft is cleaned up 
        \item Catering restocked 
        \item Planning completed and A/C refueled 
        \item Checks/safety checks completed 
        \item Boarding starts again
    \end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}

\section{Aircraft Aerodynamics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Lift: Aerodyn. Force perpendicular to the flight vector
    \item Drag: Aeordyn. Force in opposite direction to flight vector
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Standard condition: $H = 2000 m$ and $\rho = 1~kg/m^3$
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Fuel consumption}}
\begin{equation*}
    Fuel~burn~per~distance \approx \frac{SFC}{M_\infty} \frac{Weight}{Lift/Drag}
\end{equation*}
$M_\infty$ affected by aerodynamics and Engine, Lift and Drag by Aerodynamics, SFC by engine \\ \\
Equilibrum of forces: Drag=Thrust (minimse thrust), Lift = Weight (mandatory). Design goal Lift $\gg$ Drag \\ \\ Flight Performance: How far: $c_L/c_D$, How long: $c_L^3 / c_D^2$ \\¬†\\
\underline{\textbf{Forces}}
\begin{align*}
    F_D = c_D \frac{1}{2}\rho_\infty V_\infty^2 A~~/~~F_L = c_L \frac{1}{2}\rho_\infty V_\infty^2 A = mg = L
\end{align*}
The fuel consumption depends on the drag ``Area'': $c_D A$ \\¬†\\
\underline{\textbf{Eq. of motion}}
\begin{align*}
    &T cos\alpha - D - mg sin\varphi = 0 \\
    &L + T sin\alpha - mg cos \varphi = 0 \\
    &\Theta = Attitude = \alpha + \varphi = AoA + flight/climb~angle  
\end{align*}
\underline{\textbf{Why does a wing generate lift}}: The wing diverts a mass of air downwards. For this the wing acts with a force to the fluid. In return the air generates a force of the same magnitude to the wing (actio = reactio). \\ \\
\underline{\textbf{Induced Drag (Drag due to Lift)}}
\begin{align*}
    D_i &= \frac{2}{\rho V^2 \pi}\left(\frac{L}{b}\right)^2~~,~~F^* = \pi/4 b^2 (Prandtl) \\
    c_{D_i} &= \frac{1}{\pi}c_L^2 \frac{F}{b^2} = \frac{c_L^2}{\pi \Lambda} \\
    b &= Wing~Span, F=Wing~Area, \Lambda = Aspect~Ratio
\end{align*}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Induced drag ($D_i$) depends on ratio of lift and wing span 
    \item The coefficent of induced drag ($c_{D_i}$) depends on the aspect ratio 
    \item A slim wing with high aspect ratio produces less induced drag than a compact wing with small aspect ratio
    \item Induced Drag stems from the principle of linear momentum. No friction is included. The induced drag is an additional contribution to total drag 
    \item In general however, for non elliptical lift distribution, an Oswald-Factor $e$ must be considered $c_{D_{i,true}} = c_{D_{i}} / e$ 
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Tip Vortices}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Consider Oswald factor $e$
    \item Heavy Aircraft $\rightarrow$ Strong tip vortex $\rightarrow$ High Separation Distance / Time 
\end{itemize}

\underline{\textbf{Drag}}
Total Drag = Induced Drag + Parasite Drag 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Parasite Drag is depending on the Reynolds, Mach number and some velocity regimes
    \item Influence of Reynolds number: Laminar, turbulent flow and separation. Separation mainly due to pressure drag, turbulent and laminar flow due to friction drag (small contribution)
    \item Target of small drag: No separation, turbulent downstream and large range laminar flow
    \item Incluence of Mach Number: At airspeed M $\geq$ 0.7, the flow is no longer incompressible. Additional drag occurs
    \item Lift and drag depend on the angle of attack. The polar diagram describes the dependence of the lift and drag coefficients on the angle of attack $\alpha$
    \item Following components can lead to drag: skin friction drag, induced drag, profile drag, form drag, compressibility drag, interference drag, base drag, trim drag
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Flight Performance and characteristics}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Atmosphere: Aerodynamic Forces depend on the air density. The engine power (thrust) depends on the ambient pressure and temperature
    \item Steady thrust: $tan \varphi = \frac{T cos \alpha - D}{T sin \alpha + L}$
    \item Without thrust: $tan \varphi = \frac{-D}{L} = \frac{-c_D}{c_L} = \frac{height}{distance} $ flight path angle points downwards
    \item $\varphi$ is a measure for the aerodynamic quality of an airplane (how far it can travel from a given altitude)
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Drag at steady horizontal flight}}
\begin{align*}
    &L = mg = c_L \frac{\rho}{2} V^2 F \\
    &V = \sqrt{\frac{2mg}{\rho F c_L}} \\
    &c_L = \frac{2mg}{\rho V^2 F} \\
    &D = D_{parasite} + D_{ind} = c_{D,para} \cdot \frac{\rho}{2}V^2 F + \frac{\rho}{2} V^2 F \frac{c_L^2}{\pi \Lambda e} \\
    &= \frac{\rho}{2} V^2 F (c_{D,para} + c_{D,ind}) = K_1 V^2 + K_2 \frac{1}{V^2}
\end{align*}
The function $D(V)$ intersects with the function of Thrust $T(V)$ twice due to its shape. There are two optimal points with velocities $V_1$ and $V_2$, where there is no excess thrust or drag ($T=D$). However the stall speed is determined as follows with the maximal Lift coefficient from the polar diagram:
\begin{equation*}
    V_{stall} = \sqrt{\frac{2mg}{\rho F c_{L,max}}}~~~(c_{L,max} = c_{a,max} ~from~diagram)
\end{equation*}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The maximum speed (ideally $V_2$ is determined from the maximum Thrust ($V_max, horiz$))
    \item The minimum speed is the stall speed $V_{stall} > V_1$
    \item The speed range is between minimum and maximum speed
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Stability control}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Steady flight condition $\rightarrow$ Disturbance $\rightarrow$ Answer of airplane $\rightarrow$ Flight path
    \item Example: Horizontal flight, then Pilot command: elevator deflection or gust comes, then pitching moment, then determine if stable/unstable/indifferent
    \item $alpha$, $\Delta \alpha > 0$, $-\Delta c_m$, $\frac{dc_M}{d\alpha} > 0$ (positive criterion)
    \item Lilienthal: Positive long. stability, Wright: Negative long. stability
    \item Dassault Falcon: stable, Neuron (delta wing): instable, Raffale: indifferent/neutral
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Development trends}} \\ \\

\underline{\textbf{A350 XWB Program Summary - see slides 7-9 }} \\ \\
\underline{\textbf{Tasks in Approval of the A350 XWB}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item MSN1: Initial Handling, Systems \& Powerplant Tangentensteigung
    \item MSN2: Cabin Certification, early long-flight tests, in-flight entertainment (IFE), cabin hot \& cold testing, visit the McKinley Climatic Lab in Florida, USA
    \item MSN3: High altitude (Bolivia) and cold weather (in Canada) testing, performance and measurement, hot and cold weather campaigns, systems and powerplant testing 
    \item MSN4: External Noise, and lightning tests, avionics development/certification, training for pilot and maintenance 
    \item MSN5: Cabin operability training, route-proving, ETOPS (extended twin operations) certification
\end{itemize}
Comparing A350 to A340 Final Assembly: A 350 has at first the fuselage completed, then the wings are attached. For the A340, the center fuselage with the wings are first assembled. \\ \\
Important information:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A350 XWB uses mostly Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (53\% weight)
    \item An Iron Bird is a zero-test rig, which is used to test hydraulic, electrical and flight control systems. It has the same components as installed on MSN1. It is also used to test the interface between Cockpit and A/C systems
    \item The McKinley Climatic Lab is used to demonstrate the whole operational spectrum of the aircraft on ground 
    \item The EASA is the primary certification authority for A350, whereas the FAA is the primary cert. auth. of Boeing A/C. The FAA or EASA validates the approvals of their respective counterparts (bilateral agreement US-EU)
    \item Multiple screens of same type are used in the cockpit - why? Dispatch reliability/exchange capability, less stock of screens required by operator
    \item The A350 has an ETOPS Approval of 370min (2500 NM)
    \item Common Type Rating: Is approved by EASA as a way for decreasing the time of training required by a pilot to change from an  A330 to an A350. Cross Crew Qualification normally takes longer (slide 15 details)
\end{itemize}

\underline{\textbf{Collision Avoidance}} \\¬†\\ 
An aircraft with right of way (Rechtsvortritt) maintains its course and speed (also converging traffic). When head-on, alter course to the right. When overtaking, alter course to the right
\underline{\textbf{Collision Avoidance/Priorities from highest to lowest}}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Aircraft in distress 
    \item Balloon 
    \item Glider under Tow
    \item Glider 
    \item Air ship / zeppellin 
    \item Heli 
    \item Aeroplane and microlight
\end{enumerate}
\underline{\textbf{Collision Avoidance/Landing}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Landing Aircrafts take precedence 
    \item Lower flying aircrafts take precedence 
    \item Gliders take precedenced over powered aircrafts 
    \item An aircraft in an emergency situation always takes precedence
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Collision Avoidance/On Ground}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Starting aircraft takes precedence over rolling aircraft 
    \item On ground, rolling aircraft must stop if they are on a collision course, or turn to the right 
    \item On the ground, right of way applies 
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Emergency vs Urgency}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If an A/C is in an emergency situation, the commandor is no longer bound by the regulations and can deviate from these 
    \item An emergency or an Urgency can be declared. For emergencies, immediate assistance from the ATC is needed 
    \item Emergency:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item SOS (morse)
        \item 3 x MAYDAY 
        \item Red rockets (in short intervals)
        \item Squawk 7700 (on Transponder)
    \end{itemize} 
    \item Urgency
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 3 x PANPAN 
        \item Switch landing lights on- and off 
        \item Squawk 7600 for communication loss 
        \item Squack 7500 for hi-jacking
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Violence on Board/Responsibility of the Commander}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Regarding Passengers:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Passengers on board are under the control of the commander 
        \item They are obliged to observe flight safety rules and maintain order and discipline on board 
        \item After an unsuccessful warning, the commander is entitled to offload a passenger who does not follow instructions 
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Beginning and Ending 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The control of the commanding officer over the passengers begins with the closing of the A/C before the journey
        \item It ends with the opening of the A/C after completion of the journey or journey segment, and after emergency landings or accident from the time when care of the passengers is taken over from others 
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Standard Time UTC}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In aviation, everything runs in UTC (not time zones). Previously know as GMT (Greenwhich Mean Time)
    \item UTC is independent of summer or winter time 
    \item CH: UTC+2

\section{Air Traffic Control (ATC)}
\underline{\textbf{The main tasks of ATC}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Avoid collisions in the air 
    \item Avoid collisions on the ground 
    \item Ensure an orderly and expeditious flow of traffic 
    \item Provide flight information services (weather data)
    \item Provide alerting services and support search and rescue crews 
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Standard Minimum Separation}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Horizontal distance: 5 Nautical Miles (9000 m) (for approaches: 3 NM)
    \item Vertical distance: 1000ft (300m)
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Elements of Air Traffic Control}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Tower Control 
    \item Approach \& Departure Control 
    \item Are Control
    \item Air Traffic Flow and Capacity Management
    \item Flight Information Services 
    \item Military Air Traffic Control 
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Tower Control}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In control towers (TWR), air traffic controllers monitor traxiing manoeuvers, takeoffs and langings 
    \item They oversee traffic in the immediate vicinity of the airport, i.e. the control zone (CTR) of approx. 20km around the airport 
    \item The tower air traffic controllers also integrate into the often dense traffic of an airport the small A/Cs and helis flying according to visual flight rules (VFR)
    \item Working Positions: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item ADC: Aerodrome Controller - issues landing and takeoff clearances and clearances in control zones
        \item GND: Ground Manoeuvering - lead A/C on ground
        \item CLD: Clearance Delivery - at international airports. A/C receive transponder codes for final clearances from CLD 
        \item AMS: Apron Management Service - gives clearance for engine start, pushback, gives permission and transfers responsibility to GND 
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Approach \& Departure Control}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Approach (APP) air traffic controllers manage the arriving and departing A/C flying according to IFR within a specific section of the control zone and terminal control area (TMA) (region around airport 60km)
    \item Approach controllers manage the traffic climbing to upper airspace airways and descending traffic that leaves these airways toward the airport 
    \item In case of dense traffic, aircraft waiting to land be directed into holding circuits (holdings)
    \item Working Positions:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item DEP: Departure Controller 
        \item APW: Approach Controller East 
        \item APE: Approach Controller West
        \item FIN: Final Controller 
        \item CAP: Coordinator for the Approach Sector 
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Area Control (Enroute Control)}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Area control or en-route services ensure the saftey and efficiency of traffic moevements through the airways 
    \item In Switzerland, the controlled area includes parts of neighbouring France, Germany, Italy and Austria from 7'000 ft to 66'000 ft
    \item The airspace that skyguide controls at the the heart of Europe is the densest and most complex on the continent 
    \item In order to safely and efficiently control and monitor the air traffic, the area is split into various control sectors with clearly defined lateral and horizontal boundaries 
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Enroute Controllers (RE, RP, RC)}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item RE: Radar Executive (talks to A/C and controller to take responsibility)
    \item RP: Radar Planner (short-time future (15min) predictions for A/C route and solves potential conflicts)
    \item RC: Radar Coordinator (coordinates between different sectors (N,E,S,W)) - used for conflicts (extra pair of eyes)
    \item Tools and Procedures: Voice-control (RE), RP works on Systems with Radar Picture (Flight, callsign, type of equipment Wake Turbulence Category) - no more tel. required 
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Radar Labels}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Update every 5 seconds 
    \item GXXX (ground speed)
    \item rls (equipment)
    \item 260 (Flight Level)
    \item V KOR32 (Coordinate to which flight level it should climb)
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Flight Information Service}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item VFR Flights 
    \item Parachute Drops 
    \item Special Flights
    \item Gliders and Balloons 
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Mixed Traffic in the Zurich TMA}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Arrivals (Green)
    \item Parachute / Special Callsigns (Orange)
    \item Below Airspace (V in yellow)
    \item Departures (Blue)
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Tasks of Military Air Traffic Control}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item When working in the ADDC, Air Traffic Controllers are ``fighter controllers''
    \item They also manage all military aircraft in transit flights within CH. Like civil air traffic controllers, fighter controllres monitor the airspace on radar consoles 
    \item The ADDC also helps the air police with the critical task of recognising aircraft with a questionable identity 
    \item Specific deployment procedures are used in air defence training, and the protection of specified areas, e.g. WEF
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Conventional Air Navigation Technology}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item NDB for Transit 
    \item VOR for $360^\circ$
    \item ILS with localiser (lateral direction) and tower for glide path 
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{GPS}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Aircraft based augmentation Systems (ABAS)
    \item Spaced based augmentation systems (SBAS)
    \item Ground based augmentation systems (GBAS)
    \item RNP = Required Navigation Performance, RNP1 is for arrival and initial, intermediate and missed approach as well as departure navigation applications
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{New possibilities with Satellite Navigation}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Curved flight paths 
    \item Less steep approach profiles 
    \item Continuous Descent OPS 
    \item Higher Navigation Precision 
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Virtual Center Concept 
    \item Virtual and Central Services 
    \item Remote Tower Systems 
    \item Integration of Drones in Airspace Management 
\end{itemize}

\section{Airline Industry \& Business Models}
\underline{\textbf{Airline Industry}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item ...is a complex industry 
    \item ...has been developed especially after deregulation 
    \item ...is a cyclical industry 
    \item ...'s traffic volume is strongly related to world GDP 
    \item ...'s cost are 65-90\% fixed costs 
    \item ...shows decline of yield per seat-km (RPK)
    \item ...shows better productivity, worse margins of only 1-8\%
    \item ...has developing networks: Point-to-Point (regulated market), Hub-and-Spoke (deregulated market), networks (alliances, global market)
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Network Airline (Hub \& Spoke)}} = Full Service Carriers (FSC), Network Carriers, Legacy Carriers or Flag Carriers, Traditional Airline, Mainline Carrier
\begin{itemize}
    \item 2 types: Traditional/Lufthansa (Airline handles all aspects), 2. Aviation Busines Model Swiss (Airline handles mainly Flight Operations)
    \item \textbf{Advantages of H\&S Model}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Connecting many local regions which would otherwise not be served
        \item Many connections
        \item S-Curve Concept (much higher revenue with higher capacity or frequency)
        \item Large and attractive network
        \item Hub dominance (slots, gates)
        \item Advantage in the reservations
        system (Comp. Res. System/CRS)
        \item Economies of density (smaller routes can be covered by larger aircraft = lower costs)
        \item Feeding Shorthaul-Longhaul (vs.)
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Weaknesses}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Waves at the hub (Pax and therefore Crew/personell)
        \item Seducement for ‚Äúhub economies‚Äù/ sales at variable costs (Bait prices to the hub...)
        \item Optimal connection leads to ‚Äúwaves‚Äù $\rightarrow$ higher personnel requirement \& hub at the limit
        \item Short transfer times $\rightarrow$ domino effect
        \item H\&S $\rightarrow$ additional operative costs (up to +45\%)
        \item High ‚ÄúOverhead‚Äù costs (one airline fits all...)
        \item Flights from ‚Äúorigin to destination‚Äù via hub take longer
        \item Long ground times for network (A/C utilisation low)
        \item ‚ÄúPrimary Airports‚Äù have higher charges
        \item Overlapping structure (competition)
        \item Demand for direct flights from PAX (time)
        \item New airspaces allow more direct flights (chances)
        \item Overloading and security checks at ‚ÄúPrimary Airports‚Äù
        \item Competitors have more efficient aircraft
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Low Cost Carrier}} (Low Fare Airline, No Frill Airline). Main Motivation: First LCC Airline: Southwest - has never experienced financial loss. Net profit in the region of 18-24\%
\begin{itemize}
    \item Global Market Share: Stablilises at 35\% 
    \item Europe: From 17\% in 2005 to 32\% in 2013. Ryanair, Easyjet and Alitatlia 
    \item Strategy: 
    \item Advantages of LCCs:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Lower airport charges, faster turnaround times, less air traffic control-related delays 
        \item Better fleet utilisation 
        \item Lower complexity, higher capacity utilisation 
        \item Cheaper aircraft financing, lower maintenance and training cost, simpler swapping around of flight and maintenance staff 
        \item Lower distribution costs, lower complexity 
        \item Lower anciliarry costs, less complexity, additional revenues 
        \item Higher employee productivity (incentives and variable proportion of salary)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Activity Systems (Michael Porter)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Activities complement one another in ways that create real economic value. One activity's cost is lowered because of the way others are performed
        \item No catering on board means no need for cleaning and thus allows a turnaround time of under 30 minutes
    \end{itemize}
    \item LCCs generate new customers (new demand, people who would otherwise not have traveled, otherwise by car or rail)
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Charter Airlines}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Four basic types: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Vertical Integrated Organisation, tour operating travel agents, hotels etc. (TUIFly)
        \item Independents (Condor)
        \item Subsidiairies of network carriers (Edelweiss)
        \item Scheduled Airlines (SWISS)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Vertically Integrated: Parent company (tour operator) takes over 70-90\% of the capacity 
    \item As tickets are sold through mother company/tour operators and the destination is not regularly flown, a high SLF results
    \item Comparison to LCCs: 37\% of all travel destinations are offered by LCCs. FLights under 2.5h are handled by LCCs (one-way, flexibility and frequency)
    \item Advantage of Charter: Lower unit costs
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Larger A/C 
        \item Longer Sectors 
        \item High SLF 
        \item Higher Labour Productivity 
        \item Lower Insurance Costs 
        \item Lower A/C leasing costs 
        \item Lower Administration and Finance Costs 
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Sales strategies/yield management}} (Revenue Mgmt, Capacity Mgmt, Dynamic Pricing)
\begin{itemize}
    \item Airlines maximise revenue through 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Variable Prices 
        \item Seating Offer (Aircraft Size)
        \item Booking Figures
    \end{itemize}
    \item Turnover (revenue) is increased by 3-7\% and profit by 50-100\%
    \item Prices with LCCs and FSCs generally increase shortly before flight (given SLF is high)
    \item With Charter FLights, they withdraw them shortly before as quotas sold to travel agents and tour operators at an early stage
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Regional Airline (Feeder): Definition}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fewer than 100 seats and distances flying up to 800 km (turnover below 100M USD)
    \item Normally a subsidiary of an NWC (50\%), and are dependent of these feeders/capacity providers
    \item 70\% Hub to Non Hub routes
    \item Operate from smaller airports, with smaller aircraft (better financially)
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Longhaul - Business Only}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Only business seating and corresponding service (48-56 seats)
    \item Larger overhead bins, PC-Laptop Connections, Fast Track Counter, VIP Service 
    \item Popular for business customers (only like-minded people on board)
    \item Private Jet Feeling 
    \item Only possible on selected routs 
    \item Sufficient business passengers required 
    \item However, do not last long: EOS, MaxJet, Silverjet, PrivatAir (all bankrupt or OPS suspended)
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Trends}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Emerging Markets increasing (Asia, i.e. China and India) - 2/3 of population of emerging markets will take a trip in 2032
    \item Strategically different approaches between Boeing \& Airbus 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Boeing: Smaller and more A/C are needed as market becomes fragmented (=new routes and more direct flights)
        \item Boeing services: Lower cabin pressure, more humidity, 50\% larger windows, virtually larger cabins 
        \item Airbus: Markets have to consolidate, which require larger aircraft 
        \item Airbus services: Bars, casinos, sleeping areas, shower rooms (20\% lower operational costs)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Faster: Boom Supersonic 
    \item Greener: Electric/Hybrid 
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Strategies for Success}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Clear strategy/positioning 
    \item Activity System 
    \item Adapted Networks/alliances 
    \item S-Curve (Flying every day)
    \item Slots/Hubs dominance (gates)
    \item Eco of Densities (Seating/Aircraft Sizes)
    \item Ideal Capacity Efficiency
    \item Low Cannibalization 
    \item Flat waves at the hub 
    \item Freq. Flyer Program 
    \item Larger Aircraft 
    \item Longhaul 
    \item Secondary Airport 
    \item Short turnaround times = high A/C utilization 
    \item Direct Flights 
    \item Standardized Fleet 
    \item Yield Management (Revenue)
    \item Direct Sales (Website)
    \item Few ``Frills'' or modular sales 
    \item Performance-based salaries 
    \item Consideration of emerging markets and/or trends
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Value Chain Analysis}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Application: Competitive Advantage and Providing opportunities for additional competitive advantage for planning for expansion 
    \item Value-chain analysis is an instrument for determining the optimal depth of value creation and is regularly applied in the run-up to strategic alliances, mergers or outsourcing endeavors
    \item Porter: Primary and Secondary Activities
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Primary Activities: Are integrated in the actual performance process. They are accordingly arranged, ideal-typically, in Porter's model from entry-logistics to production, marketing and sales, output-logistics to service
        \item Secondary Activities: Facilitate the actual production and are known as supporting activities to the primary activities. That means they can have cross-sectional functions.
    \end{itemize}
    \item The value-chain analysis for a company must be able to consider the performance relationships between the upstream and downstream values of the competitors to be able to show all strategic options
    \item Variants
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Integration = Provision of services by the company itself, make instead of outsourcing orders 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Vertical Integration: Carry out successive value creating stages. Forward = take on activities which were taken care by customers, Backward = take on activities which were taken care by supplier
            \item Horizontal Integration: Increase Activities on the same value creation level (innovation potential)
        \end{itemize}
        \item Outsourcing = Opposite of Integration. Activities are offloaded which do not offer a competitive advantage 
        \item Cooperation = Hybrid version of both. Activities are carried out by several parties and are only bounded by contractual obligations. Both parties' skills and value creation activities should complement each other.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\underline{\textbf{Divisions}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Powered Flight 
    \item Gliding 
    \item Skydiving/parachute jumping  
    \item Helicopters
    \item Balloons 
    \item Ecolight
    \item Experimental
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Powered Flight}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Single Engine Piston (SEP): Examples - Cessna 172 Skyhawk, Piper PA-28-161-Warrior
    \item License Extensions
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Towing of gliders
        \item Aerobatics: Minimum flight altitudes of 500m above
        ground or 300m for glider pilots. Aerobatics over densely populated areas and airfields is prohibited.
        With special training you can go down to 100m for competitions.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Mountain Flight/Glacier landings (MOU)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item In Switzerland there are 40 designated glacier airfields at over 1100m above sea level.
            Glacier flights are challenging because of the reduced engine power required to operate in a harsh environment and the changing ‚Äúrunways".
        \end{itemize}
    \item Seaplanes 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Float plane flying is restricted in Switzerland, but there are exception permits for events such as the Fly-In in Hergiswil.
        Many Swiss pilots go to Como or Canada to get their licenses.
    \end{itemize} 
    \item Precision Flights (Powered Flights competition)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Theory: flight preparation: this is about exactly calculating a flight over five to eight legs, with a given wind, under time pressure (maximum 30 minutes).
        \item Nav-flight: The prepared route (length 170 to 260 km) is now flown to the nearest second and meter.
        \item Precision landings: 4 precision landings in different configurations (with and without power) complete the competition programme, whereby it is important to place the main landing gear as cleanly as possible on the zero line.
    \end{itemize}   
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Gliding}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Aspects of Gliding
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Comradship (working as a team)
        \item Learn to fly at low cost (6-7000 CHF)
        \item High Performance Sport (Alone in cockpit for few hours), make important decisions at high altitude with constant sun radiation 
        \item Learn precise flying: Gliding is about optimization in order to stay in the air as long as possible. Gliders can reach a glide ration of 80
    \end{itemize}
    \item Operations (Sources of Energy)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Slope winds on the LUV side 
        \item Using thermals underneath the clouds (cumulus), heights up to 5000m can be reached (to the upper cloud limits is possible)
        \item Wave flight: LEE waves occur in particular strong conditions on the windless side of the mountain (Lenticularis Cloud). 8000m can be reached this way (oxygen, pressure suits and thermal clothing needed) 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Cloud flights and competitions 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Specially established gliding zones with reduced cloud distance of
        100m horizontal and 50m vertical
        \item in order to make full use of the thermals, there is a so-called cloud flight, analogous to flying with instruments.
        The competition is limited to aerobatics and large distance flights.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Skydiving / Parachute Jumping}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Procedure 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Air drop machine (Pilatus Porter, Cessna 182 or 206)
        \item Classical Jump from 3500-4000m above sea-level 
        \item Freefall at 200km/h (belly-first) and 360km/h head-first 
        \item 50 sec freefall 
        \item Release of parachute at 700-800m above ground, latest at 400 m (automatic emergency opening due to height and drop rate at 250m)
        \item Round canopy or paraglider 
        \item Paraglider 60km/h forward speed and 5m/s drop rate 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Military Variations 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item HALO (High Altitude Low Opening): 8000m height and late opening (800m)
        \item HAHO (High ALtitude High Opening): Long glide flight used ($>40km$)
        \item Can be tried also by civilians 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Competition 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Target jumping: Landing on an electronic target as accurately as possible 
        \item Freestyle Jumping: Completing figures
        \item Formation or relative jumping: Formation of colleagues form as many as pre-defined figures as possible
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Helicopter}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Differences in OPS 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Can stay still without moving forwards 
        \item Parag. 38 VVR: Helicopters can fly with a visibility of less than 1,5 km if they move with a flight speed that allows them to recognize other aircraft or obstacles in good time to avoid collisions.

\section{Aircraft Design \& Systems}
\underline{\textbf{Definitions}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{System}: A combination of parts, components, facilities, procedures, personnel, skills, ... that are connected in an organized way to perform one or more functions
    \item \textbf{Function}: The lowest level of a specific action of a system, equipment, and flight crew performance on the airplane
    \item \textbf{Failure}: The inability of a system, subsystem or component to perform a function as intended (Functional Failure)
    \item \textbf{Failure Condition (FC)}: A condition with an effect on the aircraft and its occupants caused by one or more failures considering the relevant operational and environmental conditions
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=9cm]{Images/Systemisation-Aircraft-Function.png}
    \includegraphics[width=9cm]{Images/Systemisation-Aircraft-System.png}
\end{center}
Example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{System}: Navigation and Spatial Orientation (Avionics System)
    \item \textbf{Function}: Display current altitude 
    \item \textbf{Failures}: Loss of Altitude Indication. Misleading Altitude Information 
    \item \textbf{Failure Conditions}: Loss of ALT - VMC - All Flight Phases or Misleading ALT Indication - IMC - Approach/Landing 
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Failure Condition Classification}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Minor (D)}: No significant reduction in airplane safety, corrective actions well within crew capability, physical discomfort to passengers or cabin crew (Safety objectives not required)
    \item \textbf{Major (C)}: Significant reduction of safety margin, increase in crew workload, physical distress to crew or occupants, possibly including injury (May be required)
    \item \textbf{Hazardous (B)}: Large reduction of safety margin, physical distress or large increase in crew workload, serious or fatal injury to occupants (May be required)
    \item \textbf{Catastrophic (A)}: Multiple fatalities of the occupants, serious or fatal injury to flight crew members, loss of aircraft (Required)
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Failure Condition Probability}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Probable} failure conditions are those anticipated to occur one or more times during the entire operational life of each airplane
    \item \textbf{Remote} failure conditions are those unlikely to occur to each airplane during its total life but which may occur several times when considering the total operational life of a number of airplanes of this type
    \item \textbf{Extremely Remote} failure conditions are those not anticipated to occur to each airplane during its total life but which may occur a few times when considering the total operational life of all airplanes of this type
    \item \textbf{Extremely Improbable} failure conditions are those so unlikely that they are not anticipated to occur during the entire operational life of all airplanes of one type
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Acceptable Probabilites for commuter or transport A/C}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Probable corresponds to a probability lower than $10^{-3}$ but higher than $10^{-5}$
    \item Remote corresponds to a probability lower than $10^{-5}$ but higher than $10^{-7}$
    \item Extremely remote corresponds to a probability lower than $10^{-7}$ but higher than $10^{-9}$
    \item Extremely Improbable corresponds to a probability lower than $10^{-9}$ (light general aviation: $10^{-6}$)
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Design Concepts}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Safe-Life}: systems or components will survive a specific design life with no failures
    \item \textbf{Fail-Safe}: a failure will cause no (or minimum) harm to other parts and systems or danger to
    personnel
    \item \textbf{Fault-Tolerant}: a system can continue operating in the event of the failure of one or more of its components
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Examples of Design Concetps}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Safe-Life: the emergency oxygen system in an airliner. The chemical cartridges that generate oxygen have a prescribed life and must be replaced after a certain period. The manufacturer guarantees that the cartridges will not fail (meaning, in practice, that a failure is extremely improbable) during their life span.
    \item Fail-Safe: In air brakes on railway trains (Westinghouse system), the brakes are kept open by air pressure in the brake system. Should a brake line split, or a carriage become de-coupled, the air pressure will be lost and the brakes applied. The system is designed to avoid dangerous situations for people and material, and as such it can be defined Fail-Safe. Other example: Landing Gear of Pilatus PC-12
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In any system or subsystem, the failure of any single element, component, or connection during any one flight (brake release through ground deceleration to stop) should be assumed, regardless of its probability. Such single failures should not prevent continued safe flight and landing, or significantly reduce the capability of the airplane or the ability of the crew to cope with the resulting failure conditions.
        \item Subsequent failures during the same flight, whether detected or latent, and combinations thereof, should also be assumed, unless their joint probability with the first failure is shown to be extremely improbable.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Fault-tolerant: Fly-by wire system (also Fail-safe)
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Safety Processes}}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Hazard Identification (List of possible failures)
    \item Risk Assessment (consequences)
    \item Acceptable? 
    \item If NO, Risk Mitigation Method and do another Risk Assessment. If YES, done 
\end{enumerate}
\underline{\textbf{Safety Processes - Example of Safety Requirements}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The average probability per flight hour of loss of all means of altitude information shall be less than $10^{-9}$
    \item There shall be no single failure resulting in loss of all means of attitude information 
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Summary of basic principles (see script)}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Distinguish hazards from failures is essential to understand the difference between safety and reliability
    \item The criticality of failure conditions, not the criticality of faulty components, determines the level of analysis required 
    \item A safety process at the END of development is useless 
    \item The successful safety process is INTEGRAL to development 
    \item In future, the safety process will GUIDE development
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Failure Hazard Analysis (FHA)}} \\¬†\\ 
A FHA is carried out at both aircraft and system levels; one flows down from the other. The FHA identifies functional failure conditions and determines their effects. The FHA identifies the failure conditions and their effects on aircraft and crew. These allow to define the safety objectives and a quantitative probability requirement for that particular condition. \\ \\ 
\underline{\textbf{Preliminary System Safety Analysis (PSSA)}} \\¬†\\ 
The PSSA examines the failure conditions established by the FHA(s) and demonstrates how the system design will meet the specified requirements. Various techniques (such as FTA, Fault Tree Analysis) may be used to identify how the design counters the effects of various failures and may point towards design strategies which need to be incorporated in the system design to meet the safety requirements. Typical analyses may include the identification of system redundancy requirements, e.g. how many channels, what control strategies could be employed and the need for dissimilarity of control, for example dissimilar hardware or dissimilar software implementations, or both. The PSSA is therefore part of an iterative process which scrutinises the system design and assists the system designers in ascribing and meeting risk budgets across one or a number of systems. \\ \\¬†
\underline{\textbf{System Safety Analysis (SSA)}} \\¬†\\¬†
The SSA is a systematic and comprehensive evaluation of the system design using similar tech- niques to those employed during the PSSA activities. However, whereas the PSSA identifies the requirements, the SSA is intended to verify the that the proposed design does in fact meet the spec- ified requirements as identified during the FHA and PSSA analyses conducted previously. The SSA occurs at the point in the design cycle where the system implementation is concluded or finalised, and prior to system certification. \\¬†\\ 
\underline{\textbf{Common Cause Analysis (CCA)}} \\ \\ 
The CCA begins concurrently with the system FHA; it interacts with this activity and with sub- sequent PSSA and SSA analyses. The purpose of the CCA is, as the name suggests, to identify common cause or common mode failures in the proposed design and assist the designers to develop strategies which will make such failures impossible. Such common cause failures may include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Failure to correctly identify the requirement
    \item Failure to correctly specify the system
    \item Hardware design errors
    \item Component failures
    \item Software design and implementation errors
    \item Software tool deficiencies
    \item Maintenance errors
    \item Operational errors
\end{itemize}
The CCA is therefore intended to scrutinise a far wider range of issues than the system hardware or software process. Rather it is meant to embrace the whole process of developing, certifying, operating and maintaining the system throughout the life cycle. \\¬†\\¬†
\underline{\textbf{Component Reliability}}
In system safety analysis, a great deal of emphasis is placed upon the failure rate of a component or element within the system under review. This clearly calls into question how reliability values for different type of component are established. There are two main methods of determining component reliability:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Analytical by component count (issues)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item only as good as the data base of components and the factors used
        \item predicted values are generally pessimistic thereby generating predicted failure rates worse than might be expected in real life
        \item the technique has merit in comparing competing design options in a quantitative manner when using a common baseline for each design (good)
        \item it is difficult to continue to update the data base; particularly with the growing levels of integration with Integrated Circuits (ICs)
        \item increasing number of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components also confuses the comparison
        \item technique is particularly valuable when it can be compared with in-service experience and appropriate correction factors applied (good)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Historical by means of accumulated in-service experience
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Maintenance Concepts}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Corrective maintenance: Refers to the repair or replacement of components, parts or subsys- tems which have failed or broken down
    \item Periodic maintenance: Refers to the scheduled overhaul or replacement of parts (Hard-Time) or to scheduled checks and inspections of parts to remove them from service before a failure can occur (On-Condition)
    \item Predictive maintenance: Refers to the monitoring of relevant operating parameters in a part or in a system to predict an incoming failure (Condition-Monitoring)
\end{itemize}

    \item Indispensible services provided by third parties 
    \item No or only general contractual relationship between airport operator and service provider, i.e.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Skyguide: Legal mandate issued by Swiss Confederation
        \item Police: Sovereign state duty 
        \item Handling agents: Contracts with airlines 
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Performance-relevant processes are not under managerial control of airport operator}
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Collaborative Decision Making}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Developed and supported by Eurocontrol
    \item Implementation required at all major airports in Europe 
    \item Defines processes for airport operations: Rules and procedures, Input and output information requirements, Human-Machine-Interface (HMI) requirements 
    \item A-CDM requires platform (to include ATC, Airline Operator, Network Manager, Airport Operator, Ground Handling)
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Departure Management System}}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item System calculates optimum take-off sequence, based on 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item ATC flight plan 
        \item ATC slot 
        \item RWY concept 
        \item Aircraft wake turbulence category
        \item Aircraft speed class 
        \item Departure route 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Result: Calculated Take-Off Time (CTOT) for each flight 
    \item Calculation of Target Start-up Approval Time (TSAT)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Consideration of taxi time from stand to RWY 
        \item Considering Target Off-Block Time (TOBT)
    \end{itemize} 
\end{enumerate}
\underline{\textbf{Time Stamps}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Target Off-Block Time (TOBT) (must be ready within +- 5min of official TBOT to push back)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The time that the Aircraft Operator or Ground Handler estimates that an A/C is ready, all doors closed, boarding bridge removed, push back vehicle available and ready to start up / push back immediately upon reception of clearance from the Tower 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Target Start-Up Approval Time (TSAT) (created 30 min before TBOT)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Provided by ATC, taking into account TOBT, CTOT and/or the traffic situation that an aircraft can expect start-up/push-back approval 
    \end{itemize}

    \item Essential to increase efficiency of airport operations: Prerequisite for arrival steering
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Arrival Steering - Target Time of Arrival (TTA)}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Today: Regulated by Eurocontrol only (no ATC etc.) to meet capacity limits. Overdemand is delayed at departure airport to avoid airborne holding
    \item TTA Concept: Airport, ATC and Airline define together optimal sequence of arriving traffic, and gets it reviewed by Eurocontrol. Eurocontrol delays flights of departures accordingly

\underline{\textbf{The ideal Swiss air cargo movement}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Switzerland does not need Mega Cargo Hubs with unlimited space, but needs to focus on it traditional strengths in innovation, quality, reliabiliy and precision. These are the main factors
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Adequate Infrastructure
        \item Sufficien air transport capacity 
        \item Competitive cost structures 
        \item Lean but clear regulations 
        \item Effective security measures
        \item Electronic data exchange 
        \item Opennness for new developments 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Future}} \\ \\
World air cargo traffic is still expected to growth annualy 4\% over the next 20 years. E-commerce is expected to double every four years
\begin{itemize}
    \item Green/Sustainable 
    \item Being prepared 
    \item Business travel
    \item Narrow-body long-haul 
    \item Cargo vs Pax Airlines 
    \item Open Borders 
    \item Reform 
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Environmental Aspects - Part 3}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Responsibility of logistics and transport 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Logistics \& Transport has second largest share of CO2 emissions (24\%)
        \item In 2050, the European Energy Agency (IEA) expects that global logistics will have the largest share with up to 40\% (globalisation effect)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Huge differences in CO2 emmisions (Example Hamburg-Istanbul) - weight 500kg + no cooling 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A321: 706 kg 
        \item Boeing 777F (freighter): 435 kg 
        \item Truck (40t): 503 kg 
        \item Container ship: 10 kg 
        \item Rail: 7kg  
    \end{itemize}
    \item Emission values of day to day products 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item CO2 output significantly higher for Air transport compared to ship 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Calculations and Compensation 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item At Zurich Airport one ton air cargo produces an average of 11 kg CO2
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 95\% by flight movements
            \item 3\% from truck transports
            \item 2\% from the airport (handling, heating, electricity, etc.)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Conclusion and recommendation
    \begin{itemize}
        \item with the choice of the right mode of transport the emission output can be reduced
        \item Railway transport has the lowest and air cargo the highest output of CO2 per kg, however, the impact of air cargo on the global emission effects is low due to the low volumes carried by air
        \item Companies must set clear reduction goals and implement measures. They must establish clear policies when choosing their transports
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Avoid
            \item Optimise 
            \item Measure 
            \item Compensate 
        \end{itemize}
        \item Awareness in the society must be raised that not only passenger trips are generating greenhouse gases but also transport and logistics services
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\underline{\textbf{Aviation Security}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Safety 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Safety: Deals with preventive measures against the occurrence of events that have their origin in unintentional human and / or technical inadequacies.
        But also deals with comprehensive safety for the life and health of employees at their workplace (= occupational safety).
    \end{itemize}
    \item Security 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Addresses preventive measures against the occurrence of events that are committed by people with willful intent against companies or organizations, as well as the limitation or control of such incidents and the damage resulting
        from them.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Most efficient security: Control the bad and leave the good
